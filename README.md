# Greetings ðŸ––

My name is Nils and my pronouns are they/them (though he/him are okay too).

I am currently working through a tutorial series on Full Stack Django & React, you can find my code [here](https://github.com/shimst3r/django_react_series).

In the past I dabbled in [cloud automation](https://github.com/shimst3r/agipy) and [document encryption](https://github.com/shimst3r/blobvault). As you can guess, I have got the most experience in working with Python. :snake: Professionally I have mostly worked on Internet of Things and data engineering projects.

If you want to get to know more about me, check out [my GitHub Pages](https://shimst3r.github.io)!

Fun Fact: I am currently living in Bielefeld, Germany, which is well known for the [Bielefeld Conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielefeld_Conspiracy).
