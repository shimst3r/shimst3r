# Peace and a long life. ðŸ––

My name is Nils and my pronouns are he/him (EN) or er/ihm (DE).

I am a senior data engineer at [Kaufland E-Commerce](https://kaufland-ecommerce.com), the team behind [Kaufland.de](http://kaufland.de). Besides taking care of the marketplace's data infrastructure, I am leading an initiative to foster the [Go programming language](http://go.dev) within the product and infrastructure teams.

Previously I was a PhD student in the [Semantic Computing Group](http://www.sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/index.php?id=29&L=0) at Bielefeld University. My research interests were fairness of machine learning and neural language models, as well as biomedical data engineering.

In the past I have worked as a backend developer, data engineer, and infrastructure engineer at various German companies. I am always looking for interesting open source projects to contribute to (mainly in Go or Python) and for opportunities to give talks (take a look at my last one, [exercism.io - One Platform, Three Perspectives](https://youtu.be/FKXRU_KL9Io)). My current open source project of interest is [Fairlearn](https://github.com/fairlearn/fairlearn), a Python package to assess and improve fairness of machine learning models.

If you want to get to know more about me, check out [my GitHub Pages](https://shimst3r.github.io)!

Fun Fact: I am currently living in Bielefeld, Germany, which is well known for the [Bielefeld Conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielefeld_Conspiracy).
