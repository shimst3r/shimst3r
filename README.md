# Peace and a long life. 🖖

🧑🏻 My name is Nils and my current pronouns are he/him (EN) or er/ihm (DE).

🧑‍💻 I work at [OEDIV Oetker Daten- und Informationsverarbeitung KG](https://www.oediv.de/) as a data analytics engineer. My current focus is introducing large language models and validating use cases for small and medium-sized enterprises. 🤖

🧑‍🎓 Previously I worked as senior backend engineer and Scrum Master at [Kaufland E-Commerce](https://kaufland-ecommerce.com), the team behind [Kaufland.de](http://kaufland.de). Besides taking care of the marketplace's mailing infrastructure, I was leading an initiative to foster the [Go programming language](http://go.dev) within the product and infrastructure teams. Before that I was a PhD student in the [Semantic Computing Group](http://www.sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/index.php?id=29&L=0) at Bielefeld University, where I worked as a data scientist as part of the [KINBIOTICS](https://kinbiotics.de) project. My research interests were fairness of machine learning and large language models, as well as biomedical data engineering.

⏱️ In the past I have worked as a backend developer, data engineer, and infrastructure engineer as well as Scrum Master (PSM-1) at various German companies. I am always looking for interesting open source projects to contribute to (mainly in Go or Python) and for opportunities to give talks (including a talk on [Sustainable Architectural Decision Making](https://github.com/shimst3r/adr-talk/blob/main/presentation.pdf) and [exercism.io - One Platform, Three Perspectives](https://youtu.be/FKXRU_KL9Io)).

🤓 My current interest is learning COBOL! Check out my [COBOL snippets](http://github.com/shimst3r/cobol-snippets) repository to see how much I already learned.

😬 Fun Fact: I am currently living in Bielefeld, Germany, which is well known for the [Bielefeld Conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bielefeld_Conspiracy).
